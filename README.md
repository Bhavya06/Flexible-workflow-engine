# Flexible-workflow-engine
- Workflow is the sequence of processes through which a piece of work passes from initiation to completion.
- We propose to develop a flexible workflow engine that adapts to changes at runtime.
- The list of tasks to be performed for a business process is given by the organization.

### Task list
- [ ] Stopwatch
- [ ] Timestamp
- [ ] Total time for each user(with delay included)
- [ ] Clear log button
- [x] Make it flexible during run time
- [x] Show the token for each user executing in the workflow
- [ ] Introduce random delay and tabulate based on delay
- [ ] Multipath - based on number of jobs
- [ ] Org and user authentication
- [ ] Pop up tool for task
- [ ] Reject tasks
- [ ] Store logs in a file 
- [ ] Clear log - either after a fixed time period or after it exceeds a limit
